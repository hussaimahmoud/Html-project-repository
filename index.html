                <p>The function of early computers was to perform a series of individual tasks such as a calculator used to calculate numbers and perform arithmetic operations on them, and with the development and technological globalization the basic features of the operating system were developed in the fifties, which were limited to their use on specific functions such as the resident screen that can run Various programs automatically sequentially to speed up processing, and initially operating systems were not present in their modern and more complex shapes until the early 1960s when hardware features were added that enabled the use of run-time libraries, parallel processing, and in the 1980s when personal computers became popular, operating systems became Conceptually similar to that used on supercomputersDuring the 1950s, several major features were pioneers in the field of operating systems and their types on mainframe computers including batch processing, input and output operations and elements, as well as storage operations. Timer, multitasking, runtime libraries, as well as a set of programs to sort records in files, From the late sixties until the late seventies, many of the capabilities of the devices that allowed to run similar programs on more than one system evolved, and the early systems used mini programming to implement features on their systems in order to allow different basic computer engineering to appear as similar to another structure later, and since the eighties it has evolved Operating systems and their types until they became the basic and technological corner for operating programs and applications on different computers
