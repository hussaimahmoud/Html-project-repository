                <p>The operating system is a set of basic software that manages the computer and controls all the tasks and tasks that it performs. It also enables the user to take advantage of the various application software for the computer, such as printing software For messages, computations,... The operating system is the most important software, but rather the lifeblood of the computer. Usually, the major manufacturers of computers make operating systems compatible with their devices, depending on the type of processor. The user in it or delegates specialized companies to make operating systems for them, while small companies manufacture their devices to be compatible with the products of one of the major companies. Large companies to manufacture computers, and the tasks of operating systems vary according to different computer sizes. Large computers need highly efficient operating systems that enable them to deal with many computer units and the units attached to it, such as printers, storage media, and terminals as well. From providing the ability to operate for many users of the computer at the same time, but in personal computers, the operating systems are less complicated since they usually deal with one computer for one user.
